Prototype of Rigidbody-based Character Controller done as part of job interview. 
Having little time for it - only ~4 days - I did what I could to make it work as intended. 
Clean Code - Tried to give my best at the time, but I am not proud of it at all.

How to move:

WASD/arrows - moving,
Left Shift - sprinting,
Space - jump,
Left-click/left Ctrl - shooting

Green powerups grants +50% to move and jump velocity.
Character controller is based on Rigidbody and AddForce's Velocity change.
