Prototype of Rigidbody-based Character Controller done as part of job interview. 
Having little time for it - only ~4 days - I did what I could to make it work. 
Clean code not included at all :)

How to move:

WASD/arrows - moving
Left Shift - sprinting
Space - jump
Left-click/left Ctrl - shooting

Green powerups grants +50% to move and jump velocity.
Character controller is based on Rigidbody and AddForce's Velocity change.
